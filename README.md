# Multi-Class-Data-Classification-Model
TensorFlow (Keras), Neural Networks, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

What this system does

✔ Builds a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for multi-class classification
✔ Uses cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
✔ Evaluates model using F1-Score (macro)
✔ Achieves ~89% F1-score through iterative refinement
✔ Modular, production-ready code
